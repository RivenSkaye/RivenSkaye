# Welcome, Stranger

I have [a blog](https://skaye.blog) for when I do something mildly interesting, a stat dump to see what my recent activity was, and some trivia.

- ðŸš§ I have a baby steps Rust wrapper for [Named Shared Memory](https://github.com/RivenSkaye/WinMMF-rs), and should update [Zwei](https://github.com/RivenSkaye/ZweiBot). But instead I've decided to [start mangling playlist files](https://github.com/RivenSkaye/libabsinthium "libabsinthium") with a [minimal implementation](https://github.com/RivenSkaye/absinthium "WIP") following
- ðŸ‘» Playlist formats are stable, but some are cursed to work with
- ðŸŽ£ I'm looking for collaborators on WinMMF, and windows-rs-ext, but contributions are welcome anywhere!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Discord @rivenskaye, email Riven [at] tae.moe, or by telex;
  - ðŸ’¬ If you're sending me a message on Discord, please say something that doesn't seem like another scammer
- âš¡ Fun fact: monochrome TIFF images embedded in PDFs are still valid CCITT fax format imagery! Still hoping to make that decoder/encoder pair with my buddy
