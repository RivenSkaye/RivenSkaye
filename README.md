# Welcome, Stranger

Mind telling me what the heck you're doing here? I'm not that interesting! I do have [a blog](https://skaye.blog) for when I do something mildly interesting. I suppose you should enjoy the stat dump while you're here though. Oh and the short list of suggested info too, those seem fun!

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on getting a Rust implementation of [Named Shared Memory](https://github.com/RivenSkaye/WinMMF-rs) working, adding [QoL to windows-rs](https://github.com/RivenSkaye/windows-rs-ext), and mental preparation to update [Zwei](https://github.com/RivenSkaye/ZweiBot) again;
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning more about Windows internals than I'd like to know ...
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on anything really, once I have more time!
- ðŸ¤” I'm looking for help with my ways to migrate from an MS Access DB to literally anything that works.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about what I did last night! I swear it's not a bad joke, I make long days at work so night time is when I do fun stuff.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Discord @rivenskaye, email Riven [at] tae.moe, or by telex
- ðŸ˜„ I'd like to get some more time free to continue playing with the CCITT encoder/decoder I was planning with a friend. ~~wdym fax is dead?~~
- âš¡ Fun fact: monochrome TIFF images embedded in PDFs are still valid CCITT fax format imagery!
